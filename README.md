### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a bioinformatician engineer at Bordeaux University Hospital, France

I am mostly interested in NGS data analysis, interface development and statistics, computational healthsciences as well as sciences for a sustainable world. Concretely, I'm passionate about creating technology to letting the figures do the talking, because these have so much to revele. My goal is being part of a team working together in a healthy and enjoyable atmosphere, with the aim of helping our society having more comprehension about herself.

You can communicate with me either in French or English.

âš¡ Fun fact about me : I spend my free time looking for birds :bird:
