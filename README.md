I am mostly interested in NGS data analysis, interface development and statistics, computational healthsciences as well as sciences for a sustainable world. Concretely, I'm passionate about creating technology to letting the figures do the talking, because these have so much to reveal. My goal is being part of a team working together in a âœ¨ healthy and enjoyable atmosphere âœ¨, with the aim of helping our society having more comprehension about herself.
